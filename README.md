## Overview of the analysis:
Build a website allowing users to view documented UFO sightings by Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration, and Comments.
We also want to allow users to apply specific criteria to filter results based on City, State, Country, and Shape.

## Summary:

### One drawback of this website

Resetting the filtered results could be more intuitive.  It may be helpful to create a separate button to reset the search with a " Reset " button underneath the filter panel.

### Recommended enhancements
- The ability to search a range of dates.  Two date filter boxes "from" and "to."  A date picker would be handy on both fields.
- Dropdown menus on the remaining search fields that cascade after each selection.  This would help save time looking for a specific result that isn't available in the dataset.
